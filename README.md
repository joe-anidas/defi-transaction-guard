# 🛡️ DeFi Transaction Guard - Real-Time Exploit Firewall

**AI-powered DeFi firewall built on BlockDAG that screens and blocks malicious transactions in real-time**

## 🎯 Hackathon Submission

**HackOdisha 5.0 - Multi-Track Winner Strategy**

- 🏆 **BlockDAG Track ($1,100)**: Native BDAG staking, EVM integration, parallel execution
- 🏆 **Akash Network Track ($1,015)**: AI models deployed on Akash GPUs  
- 🏆 **GoFr Framework Bonus (+10%)**: Backend built entirely with GoFr

## 🚀 One-Liner

An AI-powered DeFi firewall that detects and blocks malicious transactions in real-time — preventing exploits BEFORE they happen using Akash AI + BlockDAG enforcement + GoFr APIs.

## 💡 The Problem

DeFi has lost over **$5 billion** to hacks and exploits in 2024:
- Flash loan attacks
- Rug pulls  
- Sandwich attacks
- Liquidity drains

Current solutions are **reactive** (insurance, audits). What's missing is **proactive, real-time protection**.

## 🛡️ Our Solution

**Transaction Guard** is a real-time exploit firewall that:

1. **Screens every transaction** before execution using AI anomaly detection
2. **Blocks malicious transactions** on-chain via smart contract enforcement  
3. **Protects DeFi protocols** with a simple `protected()` modifier
4. **Incentivizes security** through BDAG validator staking

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts (BlockDAG)
- **TransactionGuard.sol**: Core firewall with BDAG staking
- **ProtectedDEX.sol**: Sample DEX with integrated protection
- **Validator staking**: BDAG tokens secure the network

### AI Engine (Akash Network)  
- **Real-time inference**: <200ms transaction analysis
- **Pattern recognition**: Detects known exploit signatures
- **Anomaly detection**: Flags suspicious gas usage, addresses, patterns
- **Scalable deployment**: Distributed across Akash GPUs

### Backend APIs (GoFr Framework)
- **Risk scoring endpoint**: `/api/risk-score` 
- **Real-time alerts**: WebSocket streams
- **Statistics dashboard**: Live monitoring
- **High throughput**: Handles 10K+ TPS with GoFr concurrency

## 🎮 Live Demo Flow

### 1. The Setup (30 seconds)
- Connect wallet showing 1,000 BDAG balance
- Display real-time firewall stats
- Show system status (all green)

### 2. The Attack Attempt (60 seconds)  
- User selects malicious contract (high risk warning)
- Clicks "Execute Malicious Transaction"
- AI analysis begins in real-time

### 3. The Firewall Activation (30 seconds)
- Screen flashes red: "TRANSACTION BLOCKED"
- Shows 94% confidence exploit detection
- Displays threat type: "Liquidity Drain Pattern"

### 4. The Impact (30 seconds)
- Split screen comparison:
  - **Without Guard**: Balance = 0 BDAG (drained)
  - **With Guard**: Balance = 1,000 BDAG (protected)
- Shows $50K potential loss prevented

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Go 1.21+
- MetaMask or compatible wallet

### Option 1: Individual Setup (Recommended)
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd defi-transaction-guard

# Setup each component
cd blockchain && ./setup.sh && cd ..
cd frontend && ./setup.sh && cd ..
cd backend && ./setup.sh && cd ..
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### 1. Setup Blockchain
```bash
cd blockchain
npm install
npm run compile
```

#### 2. Setup Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### 3. Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
```

## 🚀 Running the Demo

### 1. Start Local Blockchain (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd blockchain
npm run node
# Keep this terminal open - blockchain running on localhost:8545
```

### 2. Deploy Smart Contracts (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd blockchain
npm run deploy
# Contracts deployed and addresses saved to frontend/src/contracts/addresses.json
```

### 3. Start GoFr Backend (Terminal 3)
```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
# API running on http://localhost:8080
```

### 4. Start React Frontend (Terminal 4)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
```

### 🎮 Demo the Firewall
1. **Open** http://localhost:5173
2. **Connect** MetaMask to localhost:8545 (Chain ID: 31337)
3. **Get test tokens** - the deploy script gives you 1000 BDAG automatically
4. **Go to "Live Demo"** tab
5. **Select a malicious contract** (any of the three options)
6. **Click "Execute Malicious Transaction"**
7. **Watch the firewall block it** in real-time! 🛡️

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**MetaMask Issues:**
- Add localhost network: RPC URL `http://127.0.0.1:8545`, Chain ID `31337`
- Import test account using private key from Hardhat node output

**Contract Not Found:**
- Make sure you deployed contracts: `cd blockchain && npm run deploy`
- Check that addresses.json was created in `frontend/src/contracts/`

**Backend Connection:**
- Verify GoFr API is running: visit http://localhost:8080/health
- Check console for CORS errors
