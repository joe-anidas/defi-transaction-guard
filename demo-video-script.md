---

## üé§ Speaking Script

### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
*[Screen: DeFi hack headlines, $5B+ losses]*

**"DeFi has lost over 5 billion dollars to exploits. Flash loan attacks, rug pulls, MEV sandwich trades - they happen in seconds and drain entire protocols. Current solutions? Insurance and audits - but only AFTER the damage is done."**

*[Transition to solution screen]*

**"What if we could stop these exploits BEFORE they execute? Today, I'm showing you the DeFi Transaction Guard - the first real-time exploit firewall built on BlockDAG network."**

### Problem & Solution (0:30 - 1:00)
*[Screen: Dashboard overview at localhost:5173]*

**"Here's our live dashboard. You can see it in action right now ‚Äî more than fifteen thousand transactions screened, thirty-three exploits blocked, and over 3.3 million dollars in funds protected. Every single transaction is analyzed by AI in under 200 milliseconds. And if it's malicious, it's blocked on-chain before it can even execute. No bypasses, no workarounds."**

*[Point to real-time metrics updating and threat feed showing recent blocked attacks]*

### Technical Architecture (1:00 - 2:00)
*[Screen: System architecture diagram]*

**"So how does it work? Let me break it down into three components."**

**"First, the AI analysis engine running on Akash Network. It combines Gemini AI with heuristic rules to catch patterns like high gas limits, suspicious addresses, and liquidity drains."**

*[Show AI service response]*

**"Second, our GoFr-powered backend. This handles the risk scoring, APIs, and streams real-time data to this dashboard. It's built to scale ‚Äî processing over ten thousand transactions per second with near-perfect uptime."**

*[Show backend API call]*

**"And third, the BlockDAG integration. This is where the magic happens on-chain. Developers simply add one function modifier, 'protected()', to their smart contracts. From that moment, every transaction is firewalled against exploits."**

### Live Demo - Exploit Prevention (2:00 - 3:15)
*[Screen: Demo component with wallet connection]*

**"Let's see this in action. I'm connecting my wallet to the BlockDAG testnet using real BDAG tokens. Here's my live balance, updating directly from the chain."**

*[Connect wallet, show live balance]*

**"Now, I'm going to try a malicious transaction using a contract called LiquidityDrainer. Look closely ‚Äî it wants to transfer just 500 BDAG, but it's requesting a gas limit of half a million. A normal transfer would only need about twenty-one thousand."**

*[Select malicious contract, show transaction details]*

**"Watch what happens when I run this‚Ä¶"**

*[Click execute transaction]*

**"Instantly, the AI flags it as a 95% risk score. It detects a flash loan exploit attempt, and the firewall blocks the transaction right on-chain. My balance stays safe, and the attacker gets nothing."**

*[Show blocked transaction result]*

### Impact Comparison (3:15 - 4:00)
*[Screen: Impact comparison section]*

**"Here's the difference. Without Transaction Guard, that exploit would have drained my entire wallet ‚Äî a fifty-thousand dollar loss. With our protection, the loss is zero. And this isn't just personal safety. Any DeFi protocol can integrate our guard with just one line of code. That means users are protected, and the ecosystem as a whole becomes more secure."**

*[Point to comparison charts showing protected vs unprotected scenarios]*

### Economic Security & Validation (4:00 - 4:30)
*[Screen: Validator staking mechanism]*

**"Now, let's talk about trust. This isn't just AI making all the calls. The firewall is secured by BDAG token staking. Validators stake tokens to participate in approving or rejecting transactions. If they ever approve a malicious one, they lose their stake. That economic incentive keeps the network honest and decentralized."**

### Closing & Call to Action (4:30 - 5:00)
*[Screen: Technology stack and roadmap]*

**"So to sum it up ‚Äî DeFi Transaction Guard is built on BlockDAG for parallel blockchain security, Akash Network for decentralized AI compute, and the GoFr framework for high-performance APIs."**

*[Show GitHub repository]*

**"It's open source, live, and ready for integration. We're not just another DeFi project ‚Äî we're building the security layer that protects them all."**

**"DeFi Transaction Guard: making decentralized finance safer, one transaction at a time. Check out our GitHub and try the live demo yourself."**
